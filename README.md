# ⚠️ **Important Note**


* The project was built in **2–3 days**, with a focus on **completing all required functionality**.
* Fully functional on desktop; mobile responsiveness and image upload (Cloudinary) were not included due to time constraints.
* No UI/UX design (Figma) was provided, so priority was given to **functionality**.
* All features mentioned in the assessment PDF have been successfully implemented.
